# NYC-Citibike-analysis
## Overview
In this project we were tasked to study and analyze the successful Bike sharing business in New York City as an alternative commuting way to go around the city especially  during peak hours. Bike sharing is a very efficient way to combat traffic. Using the New York CitiBike data sets, we will test and analyze the viablibilty and will apply the same concept in Des Moines, Iowa.

Deliverable 2
1.	Men checked out bikes more often
2.	Majority of the usage happened during the morning commute (7-9 a.m.) and evening commute (4-7 p.m.) during the week (except for Wednesday evenings) and 2) all day long on weekends.
3.	Although usage is significantly higher among males, the pattern of hours where bikes are most-used is the same regardless of gender.
4.	Subscribers account for more of the weekday bike activity, while customers and subscribers account for more similar amounts of weekend bike useage.
## Summary
Des Moines demographics might be different but feasible considering the population. It also minimize city pollution.  Also, like New York, they can expand to other neighboring cities such as Clive and West Des Moines along the existing trail network. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
