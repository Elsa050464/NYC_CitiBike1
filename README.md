# NYC-Citibike-analysis
## Overview
In this project we were tasked to study and analyze the Bike sharing business in New York Using the New York CitiBike data sets, we will use them to test and analyze the viablibilty and will apply the same concept in Des Moines.
## Applications
Tableau Pandas
Results:
Deliverable 2
1.	Men checked out bikes more often
2.	Majority of the usage happened during the morning commute (7-9 a.m.) and evening commute (4-7 p.m.) during the week (except for Wednesday evenings) and 2) all day long on weekends.
3.	Although usage is significantly higher among males, the pattern of hours where bikes are most-used is the same regardless of gender.
4.	Subscribers account for more of the weekday bike activity, while customers and subscribers account for more similar amounts of weekend bike useage.
## Summary
Des Moines demographics might be different but feasible considering the population. Also, like New York, they can expand to other neighboring cities such as Clive and West Des Moines along the existing trail network. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elsa.s.bustos/viz/NYC_CitiBike1
